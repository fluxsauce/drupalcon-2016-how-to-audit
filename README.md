# How to audit Drupal Sites for performance, content and best practices

Ever wanted to know if a Drupal site is configured correctly, secure and uses best development practices? Want to integrate those tests into your continuous integration setup? What about providing Drupal audits as a professional service? Join Jon Peck, author of Site Audit as we discuss how and&nbsp;why we should analyze sites, then explore how to use dozens of industry recognized Drupal and code analysis tools on both Drupal 7 and 8 sites.

By collaborating on and using standardized analysis tools, developers can save time and overhead and focus on delivering value.
